That's a great, concise definition of photosynthesis! You've accurately captured the key elements:

*   **Green plants and some other organisms:** This correctly identifies the actors in the process. It's important to remember that not just plants, but also algae and some bacteria perform photosynthesis.
*   **Use sunlight:** Highlights the energy source that drives the process.
*   **Synthesize foods:** Indicates the purpose of photosynthesis - to create organic molecules (sugars/carbohydrates).
*   **From carbon dioxide and water:** Identifies the raw materials used in the process.

Overall, it's a well-worded and accurate summary of photosynthesis.
