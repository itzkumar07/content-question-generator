That's a good, concise definition of a Database Management System (DBMS).  It accurately captures the core functions:

* **Interacting with end users:**  Providing interfaces for users to query, update, and manage data.
* **Interacting with applications:**  Providing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for software applications to access and manipulate data.
* **Interacting with the database itself:**  Managing the storage, organization, security, integrity, backup, and recovery of the data.
* **Capture and analyze data:**  While capturing data is a primary function, the DBMS also supports analysis through features like query optimization, indexing, and reporting.

So, **yes, the statement is accurate.**
