Yes, that's a good, concise definition of a Database Management System (DBMS).  It highlights the key roles a DBMS plays:

*   **Interacting with end users:** Providing interfaces (e.g., graphical user interfaces, command-line tools) for users to interact with the database.
*   **Interacting with applications:**  Providing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow applications to access and manipulate data stored in the database.
*   **Interacting with the database itself:**  Managing the storage, retrieval, and integrity of the data within the database.
*   **Capturing and analyzing data:** Many modern DBMSs include features for data analysis, such as reporting tools, query optimization, and even integration with data science platforms.

Therefore, the statement is **correct**.
