Okay, that's a good, concise summary of gravity. It covers the key points:

*   **Definition:** Attraction between two bodies.
*   **Examples:** Falling objects, planetary orbits.
*   **Factors influencing strength:** Mass and distance.
*   **Effects on Earth:** Weight, atmosphere and ocean retention.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know or discuss about gravity based on this definition? For example:

*   Do you want to explore specific aspects of gravity in more detail?
*   Are you interested in the mathematical equation for gravity?
*   Do you want to compare gravity to other fundamental forces?
*   Are you curious about how gravity affects different objects in the universe?

Just let me know what you're thinking!
